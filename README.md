## Welcome to My Awesome Portfolio! ðŸš€

# This branch is dedicated to managing the "Learn Code" initiative, an educational endeavor aimed at improving coding skills through hands-on assignments and projects. As the initiator of this initiative, I'll be updating this README.md file regularly to provide information about the assignments, progress, and any other relevant updates.

## Purpose

# The primary purpose of this branch is to facilitate learning and skill development in coding. By utilizing a headless CMS called Sanity, we can effectively manage and organize coding assignments and projects. This README serves as a central source of information for participants, providing guidance on assignments and updates on the initiative's progress.
